### fusion-plugin-apollo refactor

The 3.0.0 version of `fusion-apollo-universal-client` requires updating `fusion-apollo` to `fusion-plugin-apollo`. You can follow the migration guide 
[here](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-plugin-apollo/blob/master/docs/migrations/00159.md). In addition we have moved the endpoint token into 
the `fusion-plugin-apollo` package.


```diff
-import {ApolloClientEndpointToken} from 'fusion-apollo-universal-client';
+import {GraphQLEndpointToken} from 'fusion-plugin-apollo';
```
